# JS-Fetch-API
 JS Fetch API implementation (for txt, json and database pull)

## JavaScript
Notice that function call (FetchThis) is promisse by itself!!!
Use data inside function (response) to be shure that data is arrived.
### Method type
This script uses only **POST** method which covers all possible needs (DELETE and PUT methods are same as POST anyway, POST is also much secure than GET, so it's POST only).
### **JSON** and **TEXT** files
Examples are commented. Uncoment if you want to test it on your site. For testing purposes you have to copy test folder with sample files or adjust example path to correct path of your files on your site.
